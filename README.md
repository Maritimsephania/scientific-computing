We have three scripts so far:

1.datatypes.py

Has the aim of introducing datatypes, how they are created and how to access information contain by variables of various datatypes.
It also covers the concept of changing from one datatype to another. In this script we change from float to integer and from integer to float.

2.control_structures.py

Introduces the concept flow control with the use of example.
We have made use of the for,if and while statements to manipulate various variables.

3. Modular_fuctions.py

Introduces the concept of use of function in python.
We have a use of a function to calculate area of different shapes.

HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPTS

Install Python 3.

Copy the script into a Python file, such as data_types.py

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.

Run the script using the command: python script_name example python data_types.py

Learning Outcomes

Understanding of data types and their use cases.

An understanding of control stucturea and their implementation in python.
Also the use of match to pick the right case

Also how we can create, reuse fuction in python and set default values for some parameters.
